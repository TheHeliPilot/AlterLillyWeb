Welcome to the official development blog for **Alter Lily**!

This is where we'll share our journey of bringing this hand-painted medieval world to life. From technical challenges to artistic decisions, character development to world-building, you'll find it all here.

## What to Expect

Our blog will cover a variety of topics:

### Development Updates
Regular posts about our progress, new features being implemented, and milestones reached. We believe in transparent development and want to bring you along for the ride.

### Character Deep Dives
Get to know Liliana, Maxine, Sophie, Acacius, and the other inhabitants of the village. We'll explore their personalities, backstories, and how they fit into the plague-stricken world.

### Technical Insights
For those interested in the craft, we'll occasionally share technical articles about our Live2D implementation, hand-painted art pipeline, and the systems that make the living world tick.

### World Building
The village of Alter Lily has a rich history and lore. We'll share glimpses into the world beyond what you'll see in the game.
